// Regular Expressions: Remove Whitespace from Start and End
// Sometimes whitespace characters around strings are not wanted but are there. Typical processing of strings is to remove the whitespace at the start and end of it.


// Write a regex and use the appropriate string methods to remove whitespace at the beginning and end of strings.

// Note
// The .trim() method would work here, but you'll need to complete this challenge using regular expressions.

// result should equal to "Hello, World!"
// Passed
// You should not use the .trim() method.
// Passed
// The result variable should not be set equal to a string.

let hello = "   Hello, World!  ";
let wsRegex = /\S.*\S/; // Change this line
let result = hello.match(wsRegex); // Change this line
